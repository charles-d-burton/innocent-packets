# innocent-packets
Lets you send packets over the wire.  Think of them as a gift.

## Purpose

Just send some packets as a present to another place.  The list of IP addresses
included is purely conincidental and I found them after they fell off the back
of a truck.  

## Building

Just run go build main.go

If this happens to run on your computers and send packets that's really up to you,
I'm not responsible for any damages or harm that comes from delivering these
little bundles of cheer and joy.
